# VirtualGarageSale
This demo ecommerce website was developed with Ruby on Rails. Please know that all products on this site are NOT for sale, they are simply to populate the database to show it in action. There is currently no cart feature.

This website was created while following the "[Let's Build: With Ruby on Rails - eCommerce Music Shop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5hIc_rnpaY&index=32&list=PL01nNIgQ4uxNkDZNMON-TrzDVNIk3cOz4)" tutorial on YouTube by Web-Crunch. Knowned as @justalever on Github. The welcome page was developed solo with the knowledge I've gained from this tutorial.

-**Ruby Version:** 2.2.6
